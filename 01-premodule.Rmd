## The Motivations

TBA (note all topics could be/are courses unto themselves; lower barrier to starting to work with data in interesting ways;, motivate taking additional courses, learning more)

The data is fairly complex with data on 7100+ institutions for 21 years (and 1900 fields). It's often used to examine college completion, debt load, and a range of other outcomes. ADD MORE

It is not, however, without limitations, mostly around transfer students. ADD MORE.
