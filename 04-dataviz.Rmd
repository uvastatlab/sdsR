Exploring, communicating data:

* Motivation, ggplot2, how you visualize depends on variable types and question (distribution, comparison, relationship, composition, etc.) - quiz

* Implementing basic visualization types (histogram/density, scatterplot, boxplot, barplot, time series, etc.) - quiz, exercise/practice

* Complicating visualizations: more on geoms, aesthetics, arguments, facetting - quiz, exercise/practice

* Customizing visualizations: titles, legends, axes, labels, themes, colors, saving plots - quiz, exercise/practice

* Supplemental: modifying coordinates, customizing scales
