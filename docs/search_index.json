Michele Claibourn May 2019 Chapter 1 Introduction The start of the data science modules for the open VA tech and data courseware. 1.1 Information for Instructors TBA (structure, what’s contained, potential use) 1.2 Information for Learners TBA (structure, what’s contained, potential use) 1.3 About the Project This set of lessons began as a pilot for the Virginia Open Data and Technology Curriculum and Platform (VOCP), a Commonwealth Provosts’ Initiative In Integrated Economic Development. The VOCP is an online, cloud-hosted, virtual environment intended to provide free education resources and a configured cloud environment (operating system, tools, data environment) for an instructor and their students. Kendall Giles (Virginia Tech) and Catherine Anderson (UVA) are the PIs. Michele Claibourn (UVA) is generating the initial curricular content. "],

The data is fairly complex with data on 7100+ institutions for 21 years (and 1900 fields). It’s often used to examine college completion, debt load, and a range of other outcomes.
