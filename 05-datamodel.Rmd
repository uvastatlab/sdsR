* Motivation, modeling for inference, the linear regression model conceptually

* Model exploration and linearity (potential transformations) - quiz, exercise/practice

* Implementing and interpreting the linear model - quiz, exercise/practice

* Model specification, model comparison - quiz, exercise/practice

* Model evaluation (diagnostics, learning from errors) - quiz, exercise/practice

* Model communication (visualizing coefficients, predictions) - quiz, exercise/practice

* Supplemental: basic awareness of related models
